# MyFlix-Angular

MyFlix-Angular allows users to discover and manage their favorite movies. This is the client side of my movieAPI project.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.

## Features

- App displays a welcome view with registration and sign-on options for users
- Main app screen consists of a limited number of movies to select from
- Navbar allows access to user profile and logout options
- User profile allows you to make changes
- Users can then interact with the movie cards:
  - Select director for movie director info
  - Select synopsis for movie synopsis
  - Select Genre for movie genre
  - Select/diselect the heart button to favorite

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
